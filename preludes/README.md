# Forma preludes

These Lisp sources demonstrate how Forma grows from a small typed core into
domain-specific languages. `kernel.lisp` supplies general-purpose macros,
`compiler.lisp` defines the descriptor vocabulary, and the remaining files are
an example domain stack with elaboration and portable artifact protocols.

The OCaml conformance suite loads these files in a fixed order from
`packages/ocaml/scripts/corpus.mjs`. Applications are not required to use this
domain vocabulary: hosts and the language server accept their own prelude
paths, and the language server loads none by default.

All executable examples keep the `.lisp` extension. Protocol preludes are also
inputs to generation and snapshot tests.
