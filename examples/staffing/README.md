# Staffing Agency

Canonical staffing example as a multi-file markdown ontology.

```lisp
(export-from "./schema.md" [Address Employer Client Employee JobType Placement Policy OnboardingTask Document works-at placed-at serves-client governed-by assigned-task has-document])
(export-from "./data.md" [works-at placed-at serves-client governed-by assigned-task has-document])
(export-from "./queries.md" [onboarding-employees active-employees active-placements profitable-placements policy-coverage active-clients employees-rest-resource clients-rest-resource employer-review-tasks generated-documents pending-documents employer-pending-tasks onboarding-with-ids onboarding-metrics open-runtime-tasks active-violations resolved-violations])
(export-from "./views.md" [onboarding-workers-view employer-review-queue-view generated-documents-view pending-documents-view employees-rest-resource-view clients-rest-resource-view onboarding-dashboard onboarding-tracker employer-inbox runtime-task-queue-view active-violations-view resolved-violations-view i9-submission-mapping-view employee-profile-dashboard runtime-task-detail-native violation-detail-native active-client-portfolio-view profitable-active-placements])
(export-from "./workspaces.md" [onboarding-operations account-portfolio employee-profile staffing-api-access])
(import "./tasks.md" :as tasks)
(export-from "./actions.md" [hire-employee hire-existing-employee generate-onboarding-tasks start-i9 create-bgc-task complete-onboarding collect-form evaluate-condition send-notification generate-i9-pdf start-i9-section-2 complete-w4-task complete-bgc-task complete-direct-deposit-task complete-handbook-task complete-state-tax-task complete-idv-task mark-compliant])
(export-from "./constraints.md" [employee-email-required placement-missing-employer placement-missing-client onboarding-employee-no-placement onboarding-no-tasks onboarding-missing-i9 employee-missing-bgc all-tasks-complete onboarding-overdue-critical onboarding-overdue-standard expired-documents])
(export-from "./processes.md" [employee-onboarding])
(export-from "./documents.md" [i-9-employment-eligibility w-4-federal-tax-withholding employee-handbook-acknowledgement direct-deposit-authorization state-tax-withholding background-check-consent identity-document-verification])
(export-from "./pdf-mappings.md" [i9-pdf])
```

This example keeps the full staffing domain in markdown, but splits the source by concern so the IDE, API, and tests exercise canonical multi-file loading.
