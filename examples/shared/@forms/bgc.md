# Background Check Consent

A background check is a standard part of the hiring process. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), employers must obtain written consent from the applicant before conducting a background investigation.

The background check may include verification of employment history, education, criminal records, credit history, and professional references.

## Consent and Authorization

```lisp
(define-document "Background Check Consent"
  (description "Employee authorization for background check verification")

  (form-page
    (section-id "consent-and-authorization")
    (assignee employee)
    (page-description "Consent and Authorization")

    (form-field :text :bgc.full_name
      (label "Full Legal Name")
      (form-required true))
    (form-field :text :bgc.email
      (label "Email Address")
      (form-required true))
    (form-field :boolean :bgc.consent_acknowledgment
      (label "I consent to a background check being performed")
      (form-required true))
    (form-field :boolean :bgc.fcra_acknowledgment
      (label "I acknowledge my rights under the FCRA")
      (form-required true))
    (form-field :boolean :bgc.signature
      (label "Signature")
      (form-required true))))
