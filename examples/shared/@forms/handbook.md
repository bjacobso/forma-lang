# Employee Handbook Acknowledgement

The Employee Handbook contains essential information about company policies, benefits, safety procedures, and employment terms. All new hires must acknowledge receipt and review of the handbook as part of the onboarding process.

This acknowledgement confirms that the employee has received, read, and understood the handbook, and agrees to comply with all policies contained within it.
