# State Tax Withholding

Most states impose an income tax that is withheld from employee paychecks. This form captures the employee's state tax withholding preferences, including filing status, number of allowances, and any additional withholding or exemption elections.

Note that some states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming) do not have a state income tax. Employees working in these states may still need to complete this form if they have nexus in a taxing state.
